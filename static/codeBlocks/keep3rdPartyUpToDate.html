<p>This code block prevents security flaws in the Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</p>

<p>
  From OWASP: 
  <blockquote><i>
      There should be a patch management process in place to:

      <br>- Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.
      <br>- Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and server-side components (e.g. frameworks, libraries) and their dependencies using tools like versions, DependencyCheck, retire.js, etc. Continuously monitor sources like CVE and NVD for vulnerabilities in the components. Use software composition analysis tools to automate the process. Subscribe to email alerts for security vulnerabilities related to components you use.
      <br>- Only obtain components from official sources over secure links. Prefer signed packages to reduce the chance of including a modified, malicious component.
      <br>- Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not create security patches for older versions. If patching is not possible, consider deploying a virtual patch to monitor, detect, or protect against the discovered issue.
