<p>These code blocks protect against software weaknesses such as <strong>Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts</strong></p>
<h5>Two Factor Authentication (2FA)</h5>
<p>
Using a secondary authentication mechanism such as an RSA ID or mobile token prevents a wide range of login attacks from Spoofing and Brute Force categories .</p>
<h5>Account Lockout</h5>
<p>
The user account should become locked after more than 10 invalid login attempts at a minimum. 
The event should be logged and the user should be automatically notified by e-mail of invalid activity to their account.
</p>
<h5>Strong Passwords Requirements</h5>
<p>
Weak passwords such as <code>admin</code> or <code>123456</code> should not be allowed. Passwords should have a good amount of complexity. 
Password meters should be used to guide users on how to generate a good password during registration.

Long passwords that are made up of random words like "BlueBananaSubwayMeter" are more secure than passwords with high character complexity such as "P@ssw0rd" which are easily guessed.
<br><br>
However note that compliance standards such as PCI specifically require a password makeup that includes both letters and numbers.
</p>
<h5>Password Expiry</h5>
<p>
Passwords should expire after less than three months to limit the amount of time they could be brute forced through an online brute force or offline cracking.
</p>
<h5>Never hard-code passwords</h5>
<p>
A hard-coded password cannot benefit from expiry, reset or lockout.
