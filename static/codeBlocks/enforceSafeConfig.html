<p>This code block prevents security flaws in the OWASP Security Misconfiguration category</p>

<p>
  From OWASP: 
  <blockquote><i>Secure installation processes should be implemented, including:
    <br>
   <br> - A repeatable hardening process that makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is properly locked down. Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment. This process should be automated to minimize the effort required to setup a new secure environment.
   <br> - A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features and frameworks.
   <br> - A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all security notes, updates and patches as part of the patch management process (see A9:2017-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities). In particular, review cloud storage permissions (e.g. S3 bucket permissions).
   <br> - A segmented application architecture that provides effective, secure separation between components or tenants, with segmentation, containerization, or cloud security groups (ACLs).
   <br> - Sending security directives to clients, e.g. Security Headers.
   <br> - An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the configurations and settings in all environments.
