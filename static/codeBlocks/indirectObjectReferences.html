<p>This code block can prevent several issues from the MITRE Top 25 list.
    <ul>
        <li>URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')</li>
        <li>Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type</li>
        <li>Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')</li>
    </ul>

</p>
<p>Using <strong>indirect object references</strong> (as opposed to direct object references) means that the user input is manipulated
on the server side and compared to a list or a hashmap. The example below shows a hashmap of file resources for a server containing documents.

<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Resource ID</th>
            <th>File Name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2543626326753473534754334347753434573</td>
            <td>/var/www/myapp/files/docs/accounts.xls</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>9789694693274976937629462958605603862</td>
            <td>/var/www/myappfiles/docs/proposal.doc</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

When the application retrieves the file rather than using the actual file name, it uses the resource id and keeps the actual file location secret and immutable.
If the user attempts to manipulate the resource id it will have no effect.
</p>

<pre>
    String resourceId = Util.SafeGetParameter(request,"resourceId",ValidatorConstant.NUMERIC);
    if(resourceId!=null){
        BufferedReader fileReader = FileManager.mapResourceIdToFile(resourceId);
    }
</pre>

<p>During file upload, the application should ignore the file name provided by the user and replace it with a GUID. 
    This mitigates against both Path Traversal and Upload of Dangerous File Types. </p>
<p>If the user provided file name must be maintained, like in the case of unzipping, 
    then the application should validate that the <mark>absolute file name</mark> resolves to an allowed directory.</p>

<p>
    In a similar way indirect object references can be used for URL redirects either by maintaining a hashmap or by manipulation on the server side that will neutralize
    any non relative URLs.
