<p>This code block makes weaknesses such as <strong>XML External Entity</strong> or <strong>SQL Injection</strong> harder to exploit</p>

<p>
While it should never be considered as an effective countermeasure in itself, displaying generic error messages can increase the 
level of sophistication required to exploit a programming flaw, because the attacker must conduct the exploit <mark>blindly</mark>, without 
relying on the application output.
</p>
<br>
<p>
For example an SQL Injection attack may be a bit harder to detect and to exploit if the application only displays the message: <pre>An error has ocurred</pre> 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Obviously if the application displays the message below, it is much easier to exploit because the attacker has the exact query and 
does not need to do any guessing.
  <pre>java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Syntax error: Encountered "\'" at line 1, column 49.
Query:select * from users where usr='admin' and pwd='''</pre>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Displaying detailed error messages is a vulnerability in itself although not one of the top Sans 25 or OWASP Top 10. 
Many times such messages may reveal information about the system being attacked such as file paths or exception call stacks. 
These errors make the attacker's life much easier.
