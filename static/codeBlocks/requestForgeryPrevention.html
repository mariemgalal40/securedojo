    This countermeasure primarily prevents <strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery</strong> attacks but can also mitigate several other client side attacks.
    <ul>
        <li>Open Redirect</li>
        <li>"Reflected" XSS</li>
        <li>Clickjacking</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The primary goal of the software defense is to cause the http requests to become unique to the user. 
    This is usually done through a request authentication token <mark>separate from cookies and platform authentication headers</mark>.
</p>
<p>
    The example below shows an HTTP request protected against CSRF. It is one of the requests from this site.
</p>
<pre>
GET /api/teams HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8081
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://localhost:8081/main
<mark>xsrfToken: EITPDAj48qzt2z5J6wE4uPn6iC3ggw8imBdIeeBwknWybC-SnPCmlTdmDIPM1XRJjgXv9Gfd1RSV1RbDkaRU1w</mark>
Cookie: connect.sid=s%3AieghQmy09PUrMqYqMBlfKSW5cA4RRsLE.90RDCtrG6aJoFC74R4OfuJYXKPiZEVLtHpfP6dMNQXs
Connection: keep-alive

</pre>

<p>
The xsrfToken will be different for each user and an attacker will not be able to store the request in an external site because they won't know it.
Even if they knew the token they could only target a single user and the request would expire with the session limiting the ammount of time for the attack.

</p>

<p>
    The countermeasure works for any other attacks where the attacker would have to manipulate a request and e-mail it to a victim or store a request in an external site.
</p>

<p>
    A few CSRF token best practices:
    <ul>
        <li>The token should be sufficiently long and unpredictable.</li>
        <li>It should not be transmitted as a query parameter. It's a bad practice to send tokens in the URL.</li>
        <li>It's best for the token to be different than the value of the cookies.</li>
        <li>Best location is as an extra header. This way all API requests (GET|POST|PUT|DELETE) can benefit from it.</li>
    </ul>
